<h2>Technical Description of .NET API Solution</h2>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>This project implements a .NET Core API using Clean Architecture principles, deployed on Azure, with Blob Storage for handling image data, and Azure Functions, including Durable Functions, for executing scalable and resilient image-processing tasks. The API allows users to upload large images (up to 1GB) and retrieve resized versions based on predefined or user-defined resolutions.</p>

<h3>Architectural Components and Benefits</h3>

<h4>1. Clean Architecture</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Separation of Concerns:</strong> By following Clean Architecture, the application logic is decoupled from infrastructure details like storage and external services. This ensures each layer (UI, application, domain, and infrastructure) focuses on its own responsibility, improving code maintainability and flexibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Testability:</strong> The clear separation allows for easier unit testing of individual components, especially the domain and application layers, ensuring the code is robust and future-proof.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> The architecture makes it easier to swap or extend components like storage, message queues, or external services without affecting the core business logic.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Azure Blob Storage</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Azure Blob Storage is optimized for storing massive amounts of unstructured data, making it ideal for managing large image files (up to 1GB) without worrying about scaling limitations.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Blob Storage is cost-effective and offers flexible pricing models, with tiered storage options based on access frequency. This allows you to store high-resolution images and their variations without impacting performance or cost efficiency.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Blob Storage provides built-in redundancy (geo-redundant or locally redundant storage), ensuring data resilience and reliability, even for large datasets.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Azure Functions</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Serverless Model:</strong> Azure Functions allow for a serverless model, automatically scaling to handle spikes in traffic or large file uploads. This reduces operational overhead and ensures you only pay for actual usage, not idle server time.</li>
    <li><strong>Event-Driven Processing:</strong> Azure Functions can be triggered by various events (e.g., image upload to Blob Storage), making the system responsive to user actions without the need for complex polling mechanisms.</li>
    <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Using serverless functions reduces infrastructure costs, as functions are only triggered when necessary, leading to more efficient resource utilization.</li>
</ul>

<h4>4. Durable Functions</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Orchestration of Long-Running Workflows:</strong> Durable Functions are ideal for handling long-running tasks such as resizing and processing large image files. They allow for reliable execution of complex workflows, including retries and state persistence, ensuring that large file operations are handled without timeouts or disruptions.</li>
    <li><strong>State Management:</strong> Durable Functions maintain the state of image processing jobs across multiple executions, allowing the system to resume from the last checkpoint in case of failures or interruptions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Benefits of This Architecture</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Resilience to Timeout Issues:</strong> By leveraging Azure's durable and serverless infrastructure, the solution is inherently resilient to issues caused by timeouts or network disruptions during large file uploads. Durable Functions and Blob Storage ensure that long-running tasks can continue in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.</li>
    <li><strong>Asynchronous Processing:</strong> The system can offload time-consuming image processing (such as creating different size variations) to background tasks, ensuring the API remains responsive to users while processing continues in the background.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensibility for Future Needs:</strong> With the architecture being built on Azure's platform, future enhancements such as integrating Azure Cognitive Services (for image analysis) or more advanced data handling can easily be incorporated, allowing for future expansion with minimal rework.</li>
</ul>

<h2>CI/CD Pipeline Using GitHub Actions and Azure App Service</h2>

<p>To ensure continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), the project utilizes <strong>GitHub Actions</strong> for automating the build, testing, and deployment processes, with the final application being deployed to <strong>Azure App Service</strong>. This pipeline streamlines the development lifecycle, ensuring that every code change is properly tested and deployed automatically without manual intervention.</p>

<h3>CI/CD Pipeline Overview:</h3>

<h4>1. Continuous Integration:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Triggering Builds:</strong> The CI pipeline is triggered on every code push or pull request to the main branch. This ensures that every update to the codebase is validated before merging, helping maintain the quality of the code.</li>
    <li><strong>Automated Unit Testing:</strong> GitHub Actions execute the unit tests as part of the pipeline, ensuring that any changes or additions to the codebase donâ€™t break existing functionality. This is crucial for maintaining high code coverage and preventing regressions.</li>
    <li><strong>Code Quality Checks:</strong> Additional steps, such as static code analysis or code style checks, can be included to enforce coding standards and ensure code quality across the team.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Continuous Deployment:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Automated Deployment to Azure:</strong> Upon successful build and passing of tests, the pipeline automatically deploys the application to <strong>Azure App Service</strong>. This is done through the Azure App Service GitHub Action, which securely integrates the GitHub repository with the Azure environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Environment-Based Deployments:</strong> The pipeline supports multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production). Feature branches or pull requests can be deployed to a staging environment for testing before the code is merged and deployed to production.</li>
    <li><strong>Zero Downtime Deployment:</strong> Azure App Service provides built-in support for deployment slots, enabling zero-downtime deployment. New versions of the API are deployed to a staging slot and swapped with the production slot once validated, ensuring minimal disruption for end users.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Benefits of the CI/CD Pipeline:</h3>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> The entire build-test-deploy process is automated, reducing manual errors and improving development velocity.</li>
    <li><strong>Rapid Feedback Loop:</strong> With unit tests and code quality checks running automatically on each commit, developers receive instant feedback on their changes, allowing for faster iterations and fixes.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent Deployments:</strong> The pipeline ensures that each deployment follows a consistent process, minimizing the risk of issues caused by human error or environment discrepancies.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As the application grows in complexity, additional testing, build optimizations, or deployment stages can easily be added to the pipeline, ensuring scalability.</li>
    <li><strong>Integration with Azure App Service:</strong> Leveraging Azure App Service for deployment ensures that the API is hosted on a reliable, scalable platform that supports automatic scaling, monitoring, and patching, allowing the team to focus on code quality and feature development rather than infrastructure maintenance.</li>
</ul>
